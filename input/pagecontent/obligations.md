### Overview

Why do we need obligations? Because we want to have a formal definition of what
should happen with a message or data!

What are the obligations for a message?

<div width="500px">
{% include Obligation_mm.svg %}
</div>

Some examples:

<div width="500px">
{% include Obligation_mm_examples.svg %}
</div>

The idea behind obligations is to express three different aspects per statement:

1. the conformance verb expresses the level of requirement.
2. the activity specifies what exactly should be done. This can be separated for the internal processing, forwarding to another recipient, and as a response to the original sender.
3. expectations for the data itself
